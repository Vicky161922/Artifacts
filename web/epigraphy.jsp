            <p>Indian coinage has a long and rich  historical tradition that provides a key source of information of political and  economic changes. It also reflects the cultural and aesthetic development of  different periods and regions. </p>

            <p>Ancient Indian coinage begins with  punch-marked coins, made in silver and copper, found all over India. Issued  between the 6th century B.C.E.. and 1st century C.E. by merchant guilds and a  few ruling families, it was mainly a trade currency during a period of  intensive trade activity and urban development. Towards the close of this  period, Roman coins in gold and silver, those of the emperors Augustus and  Tiberius being most common, were also brought to India through trade. To the  same period belong a series of copper coins of the Janapadas. </p>

            <p>The issue of regular dynastic coins began  between the 2nd century B.C.E.. and 2nd century C.E., by the Indo-Greeks, the  Saka-Pahlavas and the Kushanas.. The Saka coinage of the western Kshatrapas are  dated to the Saka era of 78 C.E., thus placing them as the earliest dated  coins.</p>

            <p>It is with the Kushanas that a variety of  interesting features emerge in Indian coinage. While portraiture is common to  all the 'foreign' issues and the early indigenous issues inspired by them, the  Kushana gold coins introduce us to a series of new concepts attributing  divinity to royalty.</p>

            <p>However, for sheer variety, aesthetic  sensitivity and rich narrative content, the Gupta gold coins remain unsurpassed  by any other coinage of ancient India. With the Gupta coinage (4th-6th century)  begins a process of indigenization, Greek and West Asian deities got replaced  by Indian divinities and Greek legends by Brahmi. Apart from legitimizing  dynastic succession, Gupta gold coins commemorate significant socio-political  events, like marriage alliances (king-and-queen type of coin of Chandragupta I)  and artistic and personal accomplishments of royal members (Lyrist, Archer,  Horseman, Lion-slayer). The iconographic  representation of Puranic deities indicating the religious predilections of the  Gupta monarch, and coin legends with grandiose royal titles are also  significant landmarks.</p>

            <p>The South Indian coinage tradition of the  early period is conservative, the only exception being that of the Satavahanas  (1st- 2nd century CE), whose coins with portraits and bilingual legends were  inspired by the Kshatrapa types. Decorative features are rare and divinities  are almost absent till the medieval Vijayanagar period (14th &ndash;16th century CE).</p>

            <p>Medieval Indian coinage, represented by the  Arab, Sultanate and Mughal coins, is dominated by Islamic traditions. Religious  formulae such as the kalima (Islamic creed), the names of the Caliphs as  spiritual heads and Quranic verses in  beautiful calligraphy as coin legends are characteristic of all the issues.  Indigenous elements have been incorporated in various forms from the time of  Mahmud Ghazni (10th-11th century CE) whose coins bear legends both in the  Arabic Kufic and Sanskrit-Nagari scripts. </p>

            <p>Originality and innovative skill characterizes  Mughal coinage, which ranks among the greatest currencies of the world. The Zodiacal signs, portraits and literary  verses in excellent calligraphy that Jahangir introduced on his coins were  preceded by the Ilahi coins of Akbar, which commemorate the religious ideals  cherished by the emperor. </p>

            <p>Vijayanagar was the only Hindu dynasty  whose currency presents a rare example of a standardized issue, which later  provided a model for the European and English trading companies. Particularly  significant are the Vijayanagar coins with Venkateswara, the deity of Tirupati,  represented either singly or with his two consorts, inspiring &lsquo;Single Swami&rsquo;  pagodas of the Dutch and French and the &lsquo;Three Swami&rsquo; Pagodas of the English  East Indian Company.</p>

            <p>Modern Indian coinage is represented by the  issues of European and English trading companies and the Indian states under  British rule. Haider Ali issued  &lsquo;Pagodas&rsquo; depicting Hindu deities, while Tipu Sultan is known for his variety  of gold coins incorporating typical Islamic and Hindu features. His gold coins  were named after the orthodox Caliphs, his silver coins after the twelve Imams  and copper after the astronomical phenomenon. </p>

            <p>The European and English trading companies  brought with them their respective currencies such as the Dutch Stuiver,  Venetian Ducat, Portuguese Cruzado and English Anglina and Carolina. However,  imitation of local coins was a common practice among the trading companies with  Vijayanagar coins providing well- known prototypes. The adoption of the Mughal  rupee by the trading companies and British rulers of India marked the end of  independent currency systems and the beginning of a uniform currency for India.</p>

            <p>The coinage of independent India has  undergone a number of changes. The first major change coincided with the third  anniversary of India&rsquo;s independence on the 15th August 1950, when the designs  and the specifications of coins were changed. With the adoption of decimal  system from 1st April 1957, a new era was ushered in the history of Indian coinage;  rupee was divided into 100 units instead of its 64 paise.</p>
            <p>The coin collection of National Museum is  remarkable for its variety, rarity and antiquity. It comprises of more than 1 lakh coins, the  collection grew through gifts and purchases. The Parrukh, Jhalan, Nagu, Vyas  and Deshikachari collections have contributed to making this one of the richest  collections of India. </p>

            <p>The history of Indian coinage is well  represented in the Coins gallery of National Museum. The ancient series of  silver punch marked coins of the 4th century B.C.E. and the coins of Indo Greek  rulers are some of the oldest on display.</p>

            <p>Gold coins of Kushana period, a gold coin of  Sailodbhava dynasty with Vindya Shakti inscription, bi-lingual and bi-scriptial  coins of Mahmud of Ghazani, gold coin of Delhi Sultanate and Provincial  Sultans, Three Mohur and Asirgarh Mohur of Akbar, portrait coins and the Zodiac  series of Jahangir, coins of Sangam Age, Ram Tanka of Vijaynagar period and  South Indian coins along with the rare coins of Indian Princely States are the  main attractions of this gallery.</p>
