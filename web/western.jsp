            <p>The collection of Pre Columbian art donated  by Mr &amp; Mrs Heeramaneek represents the principal cultures of the Pre-  Columbian world. There are pieces of art from Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Costa  Rica, Nicaragua and other regions of South America. </p>
            <p>This is a rare and unique collection and  perhaps the only one of its kind in India. It includes gold and silver utensils  and ornaments, decorated earthen pots, terracotta figurines, stone implements,  stone sculptures, various grave-goods and objects used in games and  architectural elements. There are also some beautiful examples of the famous  Coptic textiles from Egypt.</p>
            <p>The Olmec culture from Mexico is  characterized by huge stone sculptures representing human heads, as well as  small sculptures in jade and other stones. These people are credited with the  origin of writing, numerals, the astronomically based calendar and the dating  system, which were adopted by other Mexican and Central American people. </p>
            <p>The Totonec, Mayan, Zapotec and Aztec  peoples had a tradition of stone architecture and producing a wide range of art  objects including stone sculptures, pottery, terracotta figurines, murals,  metal objects and illustrated manuscripts.</p>
            <p>In Peru, the oldest culture known as Chavin (  1200 to 400 B.C.E.) extended its  influence over a great part of  the Andes and Coastal regions. It  is typified with monumental stone architecture, carved in a stylized linear  pattern. A few examples of stone  carving, a small puma in typically stylized form and some linear decorated  bowls are all part of the Heeramaneck collection. </p>
