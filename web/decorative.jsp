                <p>Every culture has its distinct features,  which is clearly reflected in its art, ranging from tiles and wood carvings,  ceramic or metal utensils to textiles and jewellery. These functional objects  are created manually, and help us in understanding the social, religious,  economical, commercial and technological development of the society.</p>

                <p>The significant period of decorative arts  for the world is usually from the 16th century. However, in India, its history  goes back to the period of Harappan Civilization (3500-1500 B.C.E.). Artists in  India had taken inspiration from nature and its symbolic meanings, which is  reflected in all forms of Indian art including decorative arts.<br><img src="image/decor7.jpg" alt="" border="2" /><br><br> Artefacts of  the decorative arts group are crafted for daily, ceremonial and religious uses  from a variety of materials like ivory, jade, ceramic, textile, wood, metal,  glass, paper, leather and bone.</p><br><img src="image/decor2.jpg" alt="" border="2" /><br><br>
                <p>An array of intricate techniques such as  engraving, casting, carving, inlaying, embossing, weaving, printing, dyeing and&nbsp; embroidering are used by the skilled  craftsmen to create beautiful works of art and utility. The rich decorative  arts collection of National Museum covers utilitarian, ritualistic and secular  objects, which have been displayed in four galleries: one gallery each for Wood  Carvings and Textiles (second floor), and two galleries devoted to decorative  arts (ground floor).</p><br> <img src="image/decor4.jpg" alt="" border="2" /><br><br>
