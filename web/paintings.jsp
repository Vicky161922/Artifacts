        <p>National Museum has nearly 17,000  paintings, representing all important styles of Indian miniatures. It is one of  the largest collections of miniature paintings in the country. The Miniature  painting tradition has been a key form of Indian painting apart from murals,  cloth paintings and paintings on wood. Among miniature paintings, the main  schools have been- the Deccani (from the South), Mughal (Spanning Central and  North India), Rajasthani (West India) and Pahari (From the hills of the North).</p>

        <p>The Deccani style of painting, assimilated  the influences from Iran, Europe and Turkey and evolved into a synthesized art  form which differed from the styles prevalent in the north. The rare work  'Hindola Ragini' in National Museum Collection from Bijapur (in present-day  Karnataka) is in early Deccani style and presents the Raga Hindola where  Krishna is on a swing surrounded by lady musicians. A later Deccan period  painting depicts Chand Bibi, the celebrated woman warrior of Bijapur playing  polo. </p>

        <p>The Mughal School is showcased in a dated  folio of Baburnama, the autobiography of Babur (1598 C.E.); 'Tutinama', the  story of a parrot and &lsquo;Tawarikh-i-Alfi&rsquo; (the history of a thousand years) from  Akbar's reign. The finish, blending of colours and the bold execution of calligraphy  is remarkable in these works. Dating  from Jehangir&rsquo;s reign is his portrait and another of his meeting with Sufis.  Shahjahan is depicted in a profusely illustrated painting describing the  marriage of his son Dara Shikoh.</p>

        <p>Rajasthan is equally famous for its  miniature art, patronized mainly in the Royal courts from the 15th to the 19th  century CE. Each Rajput style from various kingdoms evolved distinctively but  with certain commonalities. There are  numerous works in the Malwa, Mewar and Kishangarh styles. Most Rajput art focused on religious themes &ndash;  the epics- Ramayana and Mahabharata, Krishna&rsquo;s life and some scenic  landscapes. 'Basohli' paintings, the  oldest school among the 'pahari' style took its name from a town in Himachal  Pradesh. There is a rare picture of  Hari-Hara and a folio of the picturisation of the famed 'Gita Govinda'  series. This work has been of great  importance in the development of &lsquo;Bhakti&rsquo; traditions of Hinduism. The Kangra  School is covered by a miniature showing King Sansar Chand celebrating the  birth of Krishna, as well as illustrations from Bhagavata Purana, Shiva Purana  and Parijata Haran. A painting depicting  a scene from the Ramayana is representative of the Chamba School.</p>
