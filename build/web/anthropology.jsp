                <p>The anthropological collection at National  Museum consists of about 8,000 objects. The collection was built over the years  through purchases, gifts by various private donors and some by the surveys  conducted by the officials of the department in tribal belts and rural areas.<img src="image/anthro3.jpg" alt="" border="2" /><br><br>  The collection was further enriched by the acquisition of significant objects  from Dr. Verrier Elwin, an eminent British anthropologist. These artefacts  reflect the rituals and customs related to the life cycles, economic pursuits  and traditions of various Indian communities.<img src="image/anthro6.jpg" alt="" border="2" /><br><br> The collection comprises of  artefacts in varied materials and mediums such as terracotta, textile,  basketry, bone wood, metal, paper, leather, etc. Out of these variety of  materials, objects such as puppets, garments, masks, weapons, utilitarian  objects, paintings, adornments, musical instruments, to name a few are spread  across two galleries: North-East Lifestyle and Tradition, Art and Continuity.<br><img src="image/anthro7.jpg" alt="" border="2" /><br><br>  The North-East lifestyle gallery depicts the composite culture of this region.  The seven states in the North East of India, colloquially known as the seven  sisters have a staggering variety of customs, lifestyles and traditions.
