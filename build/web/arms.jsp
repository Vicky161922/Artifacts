            <p>The history of the Indian sword begins in a  very early period as testified by several sculptures, paintings and coins. During the medieval period, there was  considerable ingenuity and craftsmanship in manufacturing swords. During the Sultanate and later the Mughal  rule, the weapon underwent significant modification, and weapons with Persian, Arab and Turkish  influences became commonplace during the period. Examples are the Shamasheer from Persia and  the Zulfiqar from Arabia. The enameled sword of Jaipur, the Patta of Marathas,  the Khanda of Rajputs, the Dao of Assam and some sacrificial and ceremonial  weapons are attractions on display in  the gallery. The personal swords of Emperor Aurangzeb, Tipu Sultan, Nana Saheb  Peshwa and Hamir Singh are historically important pieces on display.</p><br><img src="image/arms1.jpg"  alt="" border="2" /><br><br>

            <p>A variety of daggers, important weapons for  self protection and hand to hand combat, were also in the vogue. There were  regional variants like the Jamadhar, Jambia and Khanjar of Mughals, the Chura  of Afghans, the Khapwa of Rajputs, the Qurauli of Sikhs and the Khukri of  Nepalis. Many daggers were adorned with ivory, jade, crystal and  soapstone and sometimes embellished with calligraphy.</p>

            <p>Shields, helmets, breast, back and foot  armour were commonly used in combat for self defence. There are armours for the protection for  animals used in battles, some examples of  which can be seen in the gallery. During the medieval period, ornamentation of armour,  particularly shields, was prevalent. The beautifully inscribed shield of Rana  Sangram Singh II and the chest plate inscribed with the verses of the Bhagavata  can be seen on display.</p>
            <br><img src="image/arms8.jpg" alt="" border="2" /><br><br>
            <p>Spears have a hoary history, of use in  hunting and warfare. Spears and javelins  made of a variety of material such as reed, bamboo, wood and metal, used for war and ceremonial purposes can be seen in the gallery. The  gallery also displays weapons used by the martial races of India, like the Rajputs, Marathas and Sikhs.</p>

            <p>The invention of gunpowder in the early 14th  century C.E. opened a new chapter in the history of Indian arms. Babur, the  founder of Mughal dynasty in India, used artillery to decisive effect in the  Battle of Panipat. During the course of  time, shoulder firearms such as matchlocks, flint-locks, and percussion cap  muzzle loading guns were developed which could be used by individuals. The  gallery has a number of such fire arms on display, as also pistols, revolvers  and multi-barreled short arms. A  variety of gunpowder flasks are also displayed. </p>
