<p>The word &quot;manuscript&quot; is derived from  a Latin word &quot;manuscriptus&quot; which means written by hand. Literally,  it is used for writing by hand, whether on paper or on any other material. As a  matter of fact, before the introduction of printing press whatever was written  could be categorised as 'manuscripts'. Paper is the latest invention for  writing a manuscript. It was, however, not introduced before<strong> C.</strong> 2nd century<strong> B.C.</strong> Therefore, all existing ancient texts are found  written on parchment, palm-leaves, cloth, papyrus, copper-plates, silk etc.  According to an Arabic source,<strong><em> Al- Fehrist,</em></strong> the Arabs also used camel bones while the Indians and the Greeks used Ivory for  writing. Papyrus was discovered first by the Egyptians c. 2800<strong> B.C.</strong> which broke the ancient tradition of writing on the above mentioned material.  However, the Chinese did not lag behind and became expert in inventing the  paper. Interestingly, the paper manufacturing in India started in the middle of  the 12th century.</p>
 <p>
 So far, we do not know who wrote the earliest  manuscripts, though the history of writing may go back to more than 5000 years.  It is, however, generally believed that the religious texts are the earliest  manuscripts. The<strong><em> Tor a</em></strong> (c. 15th century<strong> B.C.)</strong> is the first recorded manuscript of the world. This is a religious text  handed over to MOSES, the Holy Prophet and it was written on stone plates.</p>
 <p>The<strong><em> Rig Veda,</em></strong> dealing with the religious  and the earliest pouring of human mind is the first text of India, though, one  can not say when it was written or compiled. The scholars and historians have  different views in respect of the first manuscripts of the<strong><em> Ramayana</em></strong> and<strong><em> Mahabharata.</em></strong></p>
 <p>The Mauryan period witnessed the writing of the  manuscripts on the subjects other than religion, and the tradition continued  during the period that followed under the Sungas, Kushanas and Guptas.</p>
<p>The National Museum has an incomplete text of  Holy Quran (7th century<strong> A.D.)</strong> in its collection inscribed by Hazrat Ali, the  fourth Caliph of Islam. It is on the parchment which is restored with a 16th  century paper, bearing the inscriptions in Persian. These seven folios, written  by Hazrat Ali, were purchased by Sultan Qutb Shah for 50 gold coins. National  Museum has further restored its folios.</p>
 <p>The National Museum has a variety of manuscripts  covering a period from<strong> C.</strong> 7th to 19th century<strong> A.D.</strong> These manuscripts are on parchment, palm-leaves and birchbark and deal with the  aspects of religion and philosophy, literature and science. There are rare  manuscripts written on birchbark in Sanskrit in Sharda script of Kashmir also.</p>
 <p>Another important illustrated manuscript<strong><em> Panch Raksha</em></strong> of the collection, written on palm leaves, was  composed during the reign of Pala ruler, Ramapala Deva at the end of the 11th  century. The<strong><em> Pragya Paramita</em></strong> in  proto-Bengali displayed here, scribed on palm-leaves in<strong> c.</strong> 12th century<strong> A.D.,</strong> deals with the Buddhist philosophy.</p>
 <p><br />
 The discovery of paper brought a great  revolution in the world of manuscript writing. From China, the art and  technique of producing the paper passed on to the Arabs who concurred Samarqand  in 751<strong> A.D.</strong> According to Abu Hamid Gharnata, Indian papers were similar to those of  Khurasani, Mesopotamian and Balkhi. Though, the paper had attained the prime  place for writing the manuscript, other materials like palm-leaves etc.  continued to be in use till the 19th century and even today the tradition is  on.</p>
 <p>The oldest manuscripts in the National Museum  are dateable between 7th and 10th century. The best preserved manuscripts are  religious in nature as the got full attention for their spiritual significance,  while the others were damaged or suffered due to the Indian climate.</p>
 <p>
 The Jain Kalpasutras are devoted to the Jain  religion and these contain the teachings of Lord Mahavira Jaina and other <strong><em>Tirthankars.</em></strong> The<strong><em> Kalpasutras</em></strong> were generally illustrated in Western India and  are written on paper. Most of them belong to the 15th century. The language is<strong><em> Prakrit</em></strong> and script is <strong><em>Devanagri.</em></strong> These manuscripts are highly illuminated with gold.</p>
 <p>Among the finest Persian manuscripts, the Babar  Namah, Bustan, Duwalrani Khizr Khan, Kalila Dimna, Razmnamah, Khamsa, Shah  Namah, Sikandar Namah, Akbar Namah and the Ramayana are simply the best. Some  of the Arabic manuscripts are the copies of the Holy Quran written on  parchment, cloth and paper, which are displayed here. The manuscripts on paper  are highly decorated as gold and lapislazuli are profusely used. They represent  various schools and the scripts like Kufi, Raihan, Naskh, Thulth etc.</p>
 <p>

 Sanskrit is the most ancient language of India  and the National Museum has hundreds of rare and important manuscripts in its  pride possession, written in<strong><em> Sharda, Devanagri </em></strong>and<strong><em> Oria,</em></strong> various subjects are covered. Some specimens of<strong><em> Braj Bhasha,</em></strong> Awadhi etc., displayed in this exhibiton, are  added atractions.</p>
 <p>The Mughal rule in India was a unique pariod for  art and literature. The Mughals were indeed great patrons of the arts. The  founder of Mughal dynasty, Zahiruddin Babur had a refined taste for art and  literature. He was a man of diverse qualities, a warrior, a calligrapher, a  poet, an art critic and emperor. He is credited to have invented new script,<strong><em> Khat-i-Babri.</em></strong> However, it being a difficult script, could not  become popular like others. According to Abdul Qadir Badauni, the author of<strong><em> Munta Khabut Tawarikh,</em></strong> the script was existing during the reign of the  great Mughal Emperor Akbar, but only few calligraphers could practice it. The  Baburnama itself shows the greatness of its literary grace and quality.</p>
 
 <p>Humayun had intensive interest in astronomy,  astrology, paintings and literature. He always used to carry a small library  with him even in the war time. While invading Khambat (Gujarat), he had with  him Taimur Nama, besides other manuscripts illustrated by the great Bahzad.  Jauhar Aftabchi, a personal attendant of Humayun, states &quot;....when Humayun  took shelter in the fort of Amarkot, one day a pigeon flying over the fort, sat  nearby him. Humayun caught the pigeon and was highly impressed by the beauty of  the pigeon. He ordered an artist to make the painting of the bird and after  finishing the picture the bird was freed...&quot;. Humayun further took new  ideas from Persian artists. He met Mir Sayid Ali Tabrezi and Khawaja Abdus  Samad Shirazi and brought them to India with him. Both were great masters of  miniature paintings besides being great calligraphers. While ascending the  throne of D^lhi second time, he assigned them to illustrate the<strong><em> Dastan-i-Amir Hamza.</em></strong></p>
<p>Akbar was not a literate man like his  arlcestors, but he had an open heart and mind for the promotion of art and  literature. A number of Sanskrit, Arabic and authentic works of other languages  were translated into Persian during his period. The <strong><em>Mahabharat</em></strong> with the title of<strong><em> Razm Nama, Ramayana, Nal Daman, Bhagwat Gita,  Bhagwat Puran</em></strong> and<strong><em> Kalila-wa-Dimna</em></strong> are few among various manuscripts which were translated into Persian. This was  an extra-ordinary era and is described as a golden age for the art and literature  of the Mughal period.</p>
 
 <p>Jahangir too was a great patron of the art and  literature. His memoirs<strong><em> Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri</em></strong> is  believed to contain a good account of history of his period. The Emperor  followed the tradition of <strong><em>Amir Taimur</em></strong> and Babur who used to maintain important notes and incidents. His<strong><em> Tuzuk-i-Asifia,</em></strong> mirrors the emperor as a politician, a great  critic of miniature paintings, a scholar, a historian and a scientist.</p>
 <p>Shahjahan, and Aurangzeb were learned rulers.  Their courts were attended by the scholars. Shahjahan tried his best to take  personal interest in promoting art and literature. It was due to their support  and taste that a number of outstanding manuscripts were produced. The tradition  continued down to the last Emperor of the Mughal dynasty, Bahadur Shah Zafar.</p>
 <p>Other Hindu rulers of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh,  Gujrat, Kashmir etc. had no less interest. They have left behind a series of invaluable that speak very high of their  respective times. A few works like Rigveda Samhita (1514) Jutish Shastra<strong> (c.</strong> 16th century, Kashmir) Sanghraini Sutra (1639), Kumarsambhava (1675) Gada Purva  of the Mahabharta (1800) among others are on show for the first time in this  exhibition.</p>
 <p>Besides some calligraphic specimens of the  Mughal period, some rare manuscripts from the courts of Golkunda, Bijapur and  Kashmir find place in the exhibition. The Dasam Granth of Guru Gobind Singh,  founder of the Khalsa, is yet another masterpiece that is exhibited in this  exhibition. </p>
 <p>The  National Museum has acquired nearly 14,000 manuscripts in various languages and  scripts, covering a large number of subjects and representing various schools  and provinces. It comprises fragmented or full manuscripts, of which about 1000  are illustrated. The non-illustrated manuscripts are calligraphic, which have  ornate letters almost transforming into pictures. Many of the illustrations and  texts are rendered using real gold foil. These manuscripts are also the source  for critical studies in arts and other related subjects. Covering a period of  about thirteen-fourteen hundred years, broadly from the 7th century to the 20th  century CE, the National Museum manuscripts are executed on a myriad of  materials such as parchment, birch bark, palm leaf, paper, cloth, wood and  metals. Besides the classical Sanskrit or sacred dialects like Pali, Prakrit  and trans-border languages like Persian, Arabic, Chinese, Burmese or Tibetan;  the collection has manuscripts rendered in Hindi and its many dialectic forms  such as Rajasthani, Maithili, Awadhi, Braj, Bundeli etc,. Many of the  manuscripts in the collection are not only rare but often bear Royal seals and  signatures of different Emperors authenticating their originality.</p>
